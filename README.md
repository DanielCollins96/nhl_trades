# nhl_trades
An interactive visualization of all NHL trades and signings since the start of the 2005-2006 regular season.

I've only included the bare bones of this project, because this was just one page from my personal site (https://cliambrown.com). If you have any questions about the code or what's missing, please feel free to contact me! https://cliambrown.com/contact/
